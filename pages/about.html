<p>Born and raised in <a href="" target="_blank">Indonesia</a>, I came to the US for college and have stayed here since then. I am married to a southern belle and we have a precious toddler who likes to be mischievious. We are currently living in sunny Orlando helping Wycliffe Associates to involve people in the acceleration of Bible translation.</p>

    <p>I enjoy a good match of table tennis. As things currently sit, I'm the undisputed champion of the office table tennis. Think you can beat me?</p>

    <p>More of a fan than a player, I enjoy going out and play recreationally. I follow AC Milan sometimes. Forza Milan!</p>

    <p>I grew up with classical guitars. Didn't know about the acoustic guitar until I came to the states. I'm not an expert, but I enjoy strumming chords and sing along.</p>

    <p>Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian (of course), American, Italian, Southern, Mexican, and etc. Now, it would be cool if that's the list of languages I speak.</p>

    <p>I think it's impossible to like food but don't like travel, and vice versa. When time (and money) allows, I always look to visit places where I've never been.</p>
