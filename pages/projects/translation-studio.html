<p class="notif notif-neutral">I completed this project as subcontractor for another developer</p>

<h3>The Context</h3>
<p>The goal of this project is to create a desktop version of the translationStudio android app. It needs to be similar to the android app but works on PC, Mac, and Linux.</p>

<h3>The Stack</h3>
<p>Utilizaing Electron, tS-desktop could be built with strictly web technology. Polymer was chosen as the front-end library because of its component paradigm and close adherence to Google's Material Design.</p>

<h3>My Role</h3>
<p>I was a part of a three-developers team. Although we all were considered front-end developers, we all did the necessary back-end work as well. The initial design came from a designer.</p>

<h3>The Process</h3>
<p>As a part of the team, I monitor the github issues and picked out the ones that were either assigned to me or that were challenging enough for me. The common tasks were centered around building custom UI components with the designed behavior, making components work together in a layout, or writing business logic with JavaScript that the components can utilize.</p>
