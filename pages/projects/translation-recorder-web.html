<p class="notif notif-neutral">I completed this project as a full-time developer for the employer</p>

<h3>The Context</h3>
<p>This is an informational website for <a href="{{ "projects/translation-recorder-app/" | relative_url }}">translationRecorder</a> app. The VP of Information Technology got tired of explaining what translationRecorder is over-and-over again to different people. He asked me to create a single page informational website that he could point people to and he wanted it fast! (2 days)</p>

<div class="captioned-image">
  <img src="{{ "assets/images/tr_web_home.png" | relative_url }}" class="image" />
  <p class="caption">translationRecorder landing page.</p>
</div>

<div class="action-links">
  <a class="action-btn btn-primary" role="button" href="http://translationrecorder.com" target="_blank" />View website &rsaquo;</a>
  <a class="action-btn btn-primary" role="button" href="https://github.com/wycliffeassociates/translationRecorderWeb/" target="_blank" />View code &rsaquo;</a>
</div>

<h3>The Stack</h3>
<p>This was built with the trifecta of web technology: HTML, CSS, JS. I used gulp to help with the build process.</p>

<h3>My Role</h3>
<p>I was the only developer. I worked with a design intern who gave me basic specs, layouts, and assets.</p>

<h3>The Process</h3>
<p>Since I had to get this up and running in 2 days, the wireframe and mockups were done with pencil and paper. After approval, I built the website and the client (the VP) filled out the content.</p>
