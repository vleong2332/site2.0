<p class="notif notif-neutral">I completed this project as a full-time developer for the employer</p>

<h3>The Context</h3>
<p>The Operations division of Wycliffe Associates needed to track the translation projects and workshops they were doing. They came to the IT department with a suggestion of building that project management into the existing translationDatabase, which was a language identification meta-database. Today, the project management aspect has been migrated to another platform. See <a href="{{ "projects/port/" | relative_url}}" />PORT</a> for more info.</p>

<h3>The Stack</h3>
<p>The website was built with Django, a Python MVC framework. jQuery was also used to enhance the front-end experience. The site is hosted by Eldarion, an excellent group of Django experts.</p>

<h3>My Role</h3>
<p>I was assigned as a full-time developer on this project, working alongside a few remote part-time developers. I handled the full-stack development, unit-testing, and deployment. At the time of this writing, I still maintain this project and offer consultation when needed.</p>

<h3>The Process</h3>
<p>I started out with designing the data model that will accomodate our users' need. That usually involved a lot of sketches on paper and on the whiteboard wall. Since I was new at working with data, I consulted with my colleagues after every iteration of the data model design to make sure it's robust. I also officially and un-officially met with the stakeholders (like, a lot) to make sure I was on the right track.</p>
<p>After every satisfactory iteration of data modeling, I wrote out the controllers and other business logic that I knew I would need. In Django, this would be the urls, views, template tags, and signal receivers.</p>
<p>The front-end presentation was done via Django's templating engine that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. jQuery was already used in the project, so I also took advantage of that. The style and script was bundled with Webpack to condense HTTP request calls.</p>
<p>Towards the end of every iteration, I wrote unit-tests and deployed the changes to the staging instance before promoting it to the production instance.</p>
