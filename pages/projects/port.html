<p class="notif notif-neutral">I completed this project as a full-time developer for the employer</p>

<h3>The Context</h3>
<p>PORT is a replacement for and evolution of the project management aspect of <a href="/projects/translation-database">translationDatabase</a>.</p>
<p>As the spearhead of the organization, the Operations department needed a tool that aids their process of data-keeping, reporting, and managing partner relationships. And they need it fast. Microsoft Dynamics CRM was seen as the perfect platform for rapid development. Out of the box, it came with needed core functionalities, but it was customized for sales. The challenge is to shape the product that fits the need of the Operations team.</p>

<div class="action-links">
  <a class="action-btn btn-primary" role="button" disabled title="Credentials needed" />View Website &rsaquo;</a>
  <a class="action-btn btn-primary" role="button" disabled title="Code is not available publicly" />View Code &rsaquo;</a>
</div>

<h3>The Stack</h3>
<p>PORT was a customized Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2016 Online. Extra business logic was written in JavaScript as form scripts or C# as plugins. HTML and CSS were used to embed web resources.</p>

<h3>My Role</h3>
<p>I was one of the two developers that worked on this project. There were no clearly-defined roles, but most of the work would be considered back-end work. Any custom front-end presentation was assigned to me.</p>

<h3>The Process</h3>
<p>To customize the system, I created the custom entities and their relationships. Although most of it was carried over from <a href="/projects/translation-database">translationDatabase</a>, a couple iterations were made to the ERM to improve the data recording and reporting.</p>
<p>I wrote form scripts to improve user's process and interaction and workflow steps (sometimes called plugins) to enforce business logic. Form scripts and plugins conforms the behavior of Dynamics CRM to the shape of our customer's need.</p>
<p>To put cherry on the top, I adjusted the theme and created the logo (inspired by Dynamics CRM business process flow) to give PORT a custom look.</p>
