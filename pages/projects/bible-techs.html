<p class="notif notif-neutral">I completed this project as a full-time developer for the employer</p>

<h3>The Context</h3>
<p>The VP of Information Technology of Wycliffe Associates needed a simple website about our team that can also act as a job application portal. He must also be able to edit the content without having to involve me.</p>

<div class="captioned-image">
  <img src="{{ "assets/images/bibletechs_home.png" | relative_url }}" class="image" />
  <p class="caption">The home page of bibletechs.</p>
</div>

<div class="action-links">
  <a class="action-btn btn-primary" role="button" href="https://bibletechs.org" target="_blank" />View website &rsaquo;</a>
  <a class="action-btn btn-primary" role="button" disabled title="It's Wordpress" />View code &rsaquo;</a>
</div>

<h3>The Stack</h3>
<p>This is a Wordpress site built with a third-party brand of Beaver Builder.</p>

<h3>My Role</h3>
<p>For this project, I acted more as a designer and content co-creator than a developer since it's Wordpress and is hosted by a third-party.</p>

<h3>The Process</h3>
<p>I was given admin access to a blank Wordpress site and was let loose. The only restriction was time (less than 1 working week). I utilized the pre-made components provided by the page builder to create the layouts and contents. I did have to write a few custom CSS rules to correct the responsiveness.</p>
