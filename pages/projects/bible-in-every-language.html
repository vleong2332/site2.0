<p class="notif notif-neutral">I completed this project as a full-time developer for the employer</p>

<h3>The Context</h3>
<p>Wycliffe Associates' VP of Recruiting needed a website that showcases the result of donors' giving and the organization's hard work. The main meat should be the different available translations of Scriptures and scriptural resources that's served through a RESTful API. In addition to that, they also would like to show the different resource types, programs, and tools that are developed.</p>
<p>The VP was the content editor, so it must be easy for non-technical people to maintain the content. The timeframe we were given was about a month.</p>

<h3>The Stack</h3>
<p>This is a Wordpress site built with a customized custom theme and Beaver Builder.</p>

<h3>My Role</h3>
<p>Designer and Front-end developer</p>

<div class="captioned-image">
  <img src="{{ "assets/images/biel_translations.png" | relative_url }}" class="image" />
  <p class="caption">Translations page, generated from a static JSON file.</p>

  <p class="caption">Part of Processes page.</p>
</div>

<h3>The Process</h3>
<p>Since time is of the essence, I chose Wordpress with a custom theme and a page builder.</p>
<p>Besides writing CSS that shapes the layout the way I wanted it to, the main challenge of this project was to analyze and process data obtained from a RESTful API and then generate a whole page from it. I decided to do all the heavy processing in Node that spitted out a ready-to-use JSON file. That file then was served as a static content by Wordpress where my client-side takes care of constructing the page.</p>
<p>Another thing that was really fun were the layout design and assets creation processes. There were a lot of lists. I focused on creating interesting and appealing bits of information through images, short paragraphs, and reasonable whitespace.</p>
