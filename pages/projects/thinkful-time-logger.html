<p class="notif notif-neutral">I completed this project as a personal capstone project</p>

<h3>The Context</h3>
<p>At the end of an Angular course with Thinkful, I needed a project that would showcase the skills I've acquired from the course. The idea is to use this app to track my Thinkful learning session.</p>

<div class="captioned-image">
  <img src="{{ "assets/ttl.png" | relative_url }}" class="image" />

  <a class="action-btn btn-primary" role="button" href="http://vleong2332.github.io/thinkful-time-logger/app/" target="_blank" />View app &rsaquo;</a>
  <a class="action-btn btn-primary" role="button" href="https://github.com/vleong2332/thinkful-time-logger/" />View code &rsaquo;</a>
</div>

<h3>The Stack</h3>
<p>The app was built with HTML, CSS, and Angular 1. Github was used to host the static website and Firebase provided persistence.</p>

<h3>My Role</h3>
<p>This is a personal project, so I did everything.</p>

<h3>The Process</h3>
<p>I wanted each component on the app (the timer, the text-editor, etc.) to be as modular as possible. They were built as child components that live inside the parent app component where data flows.</p>
<p>To enable persistence, I must be able to associate data with a user. For this purpose, I associate someone's data with their google account (since everyone has a google account, right?).</p>
